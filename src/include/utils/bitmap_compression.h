 * bitmap_compression
 *
 * A custom bitmap compression algorithm is based on the special assumption 
 * that a bitmap will either contain long ranges of 0-bits or 1-bits. 
 * Therefore the compression is a simple 32-bit block-based entropy encoder 
 * with predefined probabilities. 
 * 
 * Due to the predefined entropy distribution, this is not a general purpose
 * bitmap compression. Similarly, bitmap compression algorithms in the 
 * research literature are often focused on the compression of bitmaps
 * in bitmap indexes. These algorithms have build in assumptions not
 * given in the use case this compression algorithm was developed for.
