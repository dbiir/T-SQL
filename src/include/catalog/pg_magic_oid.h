/* ----------
 *		Object ID (OID) zero is InvalidOid.
 *
 *		OIDs 1-9999 are reserved for manual assignment (see the files
 *		in src/include/catalog/).
 *
 *		OIDS 10000-16383 are reserved for assignment during initdb
 *		using the OID generator.  (We start the generator at 10000.)
 *
 *		OIDs beginning at 16384 are assigned from the OID generator
 *		during normal multiuser operation.  (We force the generator up to
 *		16384 as soon as we are in normal operation.)
 *
 * The choices of 10000 and 16384 are completely arbitrary, and can be moved
 * if we run low on OIDs in either category.  Changing the macros below
 * should be sufficient to do this.
 *
 * NOTE: if the OID generator wraps around, we skip over OIDs 0-16383
 * and resume with 16384.  This minimizes the odds of OID conflict, by not
 * reassigning OIDs that might have been assigned during initdb.
