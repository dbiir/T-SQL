# Test validating concurrent insert to AO with appendonlywriter hashtable entry eviction.
#
# Scenario test validates is concurrent insert to AO
#    - after it has acquired the snapshot and
#    - hashtable entry recording concurrent insert transactions id in
# latestWriteXid got evicted out
#     - and then it performs the segment-file selection for inserting data
# Using serializable transaction here just for easy/comfort to grab snapshot
# before AO segment file selection logic kicks-in. Same test can be easily
# written without serializable by using fault-injector, by suspending insert
# statement after acquiring snapshot but before reaching segment file selection
# logic for AO.
# Without the fix for using SnapshotNow to read aoseg during inserts, it used to
# overwrite and corrupt the data in some cases or error out inserts hiting the
# sanity checks.
