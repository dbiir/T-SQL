=head1 NAME

B<gpdiff.pl> - GreenPlum diff

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<gpdiff.pl> [options] logfile [logfile...]

Options:

Normally, gpdiff takes the standard "diff" options and passes them
directly to the diff program.  Try `diff --help' for more information
on the standard options.  The following options are specific to gpdiff:

    -help                 brief help message
    -man                  full documentation
    -version              print gpdiff version and underlying diff version
    -verbose              print verbose info
    -gpd_ignore_headers   ignore header lines in query output
    -gpd_ignore_plans     ignore explain plan content in input files
    -gpd_init <file>      load initialization file

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<-help>

    Print a brief help message and exits.

=item B<-man>

    Prints the manual page and exits.

=item B<-version>

    Prints the gpdiff version and underlying diff version

=item B<-verbose>

    Prints verbose information.

=item B<-gpd_ignore_headers>

gpdiff/atmsort expect PostgreSQL "psql-style" output for SELECT
statements, with a two line header composed of the column names,
separated by vertical bars (|), and a "separator" line of dashes and
pluses beneath, followed by the row output.  The psql utility performs
some formatting to adjust the column widths to match the size of the
row output.  Setting this parameter causes gpdiff to ignore any
differences in the column naming and format widths globally.

=item B<-gpd_ignore_plans>

Specify this option to ignore any explain plan diffs between the
input files. This will completely ignore any plan content in
the input files thus masking differences in plans between the input files.

=item B<-gpd_init> <file>

Specify an initialization file containing a series of directives
(mainly for match_subs) that get applied to the input files.  To
specify multiple initialization files, use multiple gpd_init arguments, eg:

  -gpd_init file1 -gpd_init file2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

gpdiff compares files using diff after processing them with atmsort.pm.
This comparison is designed to ignore certain Greenplum-specific
informational messages, as well as handle the cases where query output
order may differ for a multi-segment Greenplum database versus a
single PostgreSQL instance.  Type "atmsort.pl --man" for more details.
gpdiff is invoked by pg_regress as part of "make installcheck-world".
In this case the diff options are something like:

 "-w -I NOTICE: -I HINT: -I CONTEXT: -I GP_IGNORE:".

Like diff, gpdiff can compare two files, a file and directory, a
directory and file, and two directories.  However, when gpdiff compares
two directories, it only returns the exit status of the diff
comparison of the final two files.

=head1 BUGS

While the exit status is set correctly for most cases,
STDERR messages from diff are not displayed.

Also, atmsort cannot handle "unsorted" SELECT queries where the output
has strings with embedded newlines or pipe ("|") characters due to
limitations with the parser in the "tablelizer" function.  Queries
with these characteristics must have an ORDER BY clause to avoid
potential erroneous comparison.
