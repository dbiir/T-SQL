-- Run some basic tests on the gp_toolkit functions that deal with AO segfiles.
-- The exact output varies depending on cluster configuration and concurrent
-- activity in the system, so for most functions, we only do count(*). That
-- at least verifies that they don't crash.

-- Create test tables
--
-- We use DISTRIBUTED BY (c), and have the same c value in all the rows, to
-- put all the rows on the same segment. That way, the test output doesn't
-- depend on the number of segments.
