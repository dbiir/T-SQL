Documentation concerning how to run these regression tests and interpret
the results can be found in the PostgreSQL manual, in the chapter
"Regression Tests".

UAO row and column test generation
----------------------------------

Row and column orientation tests can be generated from one .source test
for Updatable Append Optimized (UAO) tables.  Place the UAO .source
tests under input/uao*/ directory, e.g. input/uao_ddl/.  Place
corresponding answer files, also named as .source, into output/uao*/
directory.  The .source files must begin with the following header:

    create schema <filename_prefix>@orientation@;
    set search_path="$user",<filename_prefix>@orientation@,public;
    SET gp_default_storage_options='orientation=@orientation@';

The schema creation is necessary to ensure tables created by _row.sql
files don't conflict with those created by _column.sql.  Using the
filename part of .source files is the easiest way to ensure uniqueness.
Replace "<filename_prefix>" with actual filename of .source files.

UAO tables can then be created in the .source test by specifying "with
(appendonly=true)" in the create table command.  Orientation of this
table is determined by the gp_default_storage_options value.

Optimizer specific answer files may be named the usual way.
E.g. create_ao_tables.source and create_ao_tables_optimizer.source.

Having file GENERATE_ROW_AND_COLUMN_FILES in the directory conveys
pg_regress to generate the UAO row and column tests.

Testing setup without teardown, allowing DB objects to persist
--------------------------------------------------------------
Please leave objects behind in the regression database.

The regression database that results from installcheck-world
in the regress directory is utilized for integration testing
of auxiliary tools such as gpbackup and gpupgrade. When writing
testcases for new object types, a set of objects should be
preserved in the regression database and not be dropped
at the end of the test suite, to ensure coverage in the
tests of auxiliary tools.
