-- This test validates that dirty relfiles are sync'ed by checkpoint
-- process.  It simulates the following scenario.
--
--   * Start with a clean slate - ensure that all dirty buffers are
--     flushed by creating a checkpoint.
--   * Suspend bgwriter at the beginning of main loop.
--   * Suspend checkpointer process by injecting skip fault.
--   * Make buffers of two tables dirty (fsync_test1 and fsync_test2).
--   * Resume bgwriter so that it performs a round of writing out dirty
--     buffers.
--   * Resume checkpointer and let it fsync the two dirty relfiles
--     corresponding to fsync_test1 and fsync_test2 tables.
--   * Verify that at least two files were fsync'ed by checkpointer.
--
-- the hit times of fsync_counter is undetermined, both 5, 6 or 7 are
-- correct, so mark them out to make case stable.
-- start_matchsubs
-- m/num times hit:\'[5-7]\'/
-- s/num times hit:\'[5-7]\'/num times hit:\'greater_than_two\'/
