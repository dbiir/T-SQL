This directory contains additional "isolation"-style tests. That is,
tests that require multiple simultaneous connections to the database.

Some of these could be moved to the main isolation test suite, in
src/test/isolation, but for historical reasons, these tests use a different
syntax for specifying the tests. See sql_isolation_testcase.py for more
details on the syntax.
