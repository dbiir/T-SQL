-- A function that:
--
-- 1. Establishes a snapshot, without launching any QE backends. It does this
--    by selecting from pg_database.
-- 2. Sleeps 10 seconds
-- 3. runs "select count(*) from test_recently_dead_utility"
--
-- It would've been more clear to use a transaction block, "BEGIN; ... COMMIT"
-- for these steps. However, BEGIN immediately starts connections to the QE
-- nodes, and we don't want to acquire local snapshots in the QE nodes, until
-- step 3. Instead, run these steps in a function that's marked as STABLE.
-- (A VOLATILE function would acquire a different snapshot for each command
-- in the function, but we want it all to run with a single snapshot.)
--
-- (All on one line because of limitations in the isolation2 test language.)
