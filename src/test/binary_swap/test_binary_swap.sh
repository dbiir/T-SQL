## Test binary swap from current Greenplum install to another
## Greenplum install. The flow goes like this:
##   1. Run pg_dumpall on current database
##   2. Start binaries provided by -b (required)
##   3. Run pg_dumpall on other binary and diff dumps
##   4. Run some inserts and do another pg_dumpall
##   5. Start binaries provided by -c (default current $GPHOME).
##   6. Run pg_dumpall on current binary and diff dumps
##   7. Run some more inserts and run another pg_dumpall
##
## Providing the binaries can be interchangeable between -b and -c
## but technically shouldn't matter. However, the binary provided in
## -c will be the active binary at the end of the run.
