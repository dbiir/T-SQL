if gpfdist runs on a remote server, we can run gpdb on a linux
server, then run the regress test cases in this folder on the linux
server to test if the gpfdist can work well.

Now we just support gpfdist on a remote windows server.
make installcheck_win can test gpfdist of windows.
Need to export REMOTE_HOST, REMOTE_PORT, REMOTE_USER, REMOTE_KEY
MASTER_DATA_DIRECTORY, PG_PORT before running these test cases.

The scripts of start_gpfdist_remote_win are used to start and stop gpfdist runing on windows.
If you want to test gpfdist on another os,such as aix, you can create a forlder named
start_gpfdist_remote_aix and add some scripts to start and stop gpfdist.
