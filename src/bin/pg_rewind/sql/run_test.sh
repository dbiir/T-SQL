# pg_rewind.sh
#
# Test driver for pg_rewind. This test script initdb's and configures a
# cluster and creates a table with some data in it. Then, it makes a
# standby of it with pg_basebackup, and promotes the standby.
#
# The result is two clusters, so that the old "master" cluster can be
# resynchronized with pg_rewind to catch up with the new "standby" cluster.
# This test can be run with either a local data folder or a remote
# connection as source.
#
# Before running this script, the calling script should've included
# config_test.sh, and defined four functions to define the test case:
#
#  before_master   - runs after initializing the master, before starting it
#  before_standby  - runs after starting the master, before creating the
#                    standby
#  standby_following_master - runs after standby has been created and started
#  after_promotion - runs after standby has been promoted, but old master is
#                    still running
#  before_master_restart_after_rewind - runs after pg_rewind executes and the
#                    master has not been restarted
#  after_rewind    - runs after pg_rewind and after restarting the rewound
#                    old master
#
# In those functions, the test script can use $MASTER_PSQL and $STANDBY_PSQL
# to run psql against the master and standby servers, to cause the servers
# to diverge.
