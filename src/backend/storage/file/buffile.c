 * IDENTIFICATION
 *	  src/backend/storage/file/buffile.c
 *
 * NOTES:
 *
 * BufFiles provide a very incomplete emulation of stdio atop virtual Files
 * (as managed by fd.c).  Currently, we only support the buffered-I/O
 * aspect of stdio: a read or write of the low-level File occurs only
 * when the buffer is filled or emptied.  This is an even bigger win
 * for virtual Files than for ordinary kernel files, since reducing the
 * frequency with which a virtual File is touched reduces "thrashing"
 * of opening/closing file descriptors.
 *
 * Note that BufFile structs are allocated with palloc(), and therefore
 * will go away automatically at transaction end.  If the underlying
 * virtual File is made with OpenTemporaryFile, then all resources for
 * the file are certain to be cleaned up even if processing is aborted
 * by ereport(ERROR).  The data structures required are made in the
 * palloc context that was current when the BufFile was created, and
 * any external resources such as temp files are owned by the ResourceOwner
 * that was current at that time.
 *
 * BufFile also supports temporary files that exceed the OS file size limit
 * (by opening multiple fd.c temporary files).  This is an essential feature
 * for sorts and hashjoins on large amounts of data.
 *
 * GPDB:
 *
 * The purpose of BufFiles is the same in GPDB as in PostgreSQL, but the
 * implementation has been changed somewhat:
 *
 * - PostgreSQL breaks the files into 1 GB segments. We don't do that in
 *   GPDB. The 'fileno' argument in BufFileSeek/tell is unused.
 *
 * - There is an additional concept of "work files", and tracking their
 *   sizes by the "workfile manager". Work file is another name for
 *   a temporary file, but we track their sizes in shared memory, and
 *   enforce additional limits. Buffile code (and fd.c) has been modified
 *   to for the tracking.
 *
 * - The buffer management works slightly differently. It's not visible
 *   to callers, but ought to perform better.
 *
 * - We support compressing the files, with some limitations. See
 *   BufFilePledgeSequential().
