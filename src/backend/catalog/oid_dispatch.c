 * oid_dispatch.c
 *		Functions to ensure that QD and QEs use same OIDs for catalog objects.
 *
 *
 * In Greenplum, it's important that most objects, like relations,
 * functions, operators, have the same OIDs in the master and all QE nodes.
 * Otherwise query plans generated in the master will not work on the QE
 * nodes, because they use the master's OIDs to refer to objects.
 *
 * Whenever a CREATE statement, or any other command that creates new
 * objects, is dispatched, the master also needs to tell the QE servers which
 * OIDs to use for the new objects. Before GPDB 5.0, that was done by
 * modifying all the structs representing DDL statements, like DefineStmt,
 * CreateOpClassStmt, and so forth, by adding a new OID field to them.
 * However, that was annoying when merging with the upstream, because it
 * required scattered changes to all the structs, and the accompanying
 * routines to copy and serialize them. Moreover, for more complicated object
 * types, like a table, a single OID was not enough, as CREATE TABLE not only
 * creates the entry in pg_class, it also creates a composite type, an array
 * type for the composite type, and possibly the same for the associated
 * toast table.
 *
 * Starting with GPDB 5.0, we take a different tact. Whenever an OID is
 * assigned for a system table in the QD node, the OID is recorded in private
 * memory, in the 'dispatch_oids' list, along with the key for that object.
 * AddDispatchOidFromTuple() function does that, and it's called from
 * heap_insert(). For example, when a new type is created, the OID of the new
 * type, and the namespace and the type name of the new type, are recorded in
 * the 'dispatch_oids' list.  When the command is dispatched to the QE
 * servers, all the recorded OIDs are included in the dispatched request, and
 * the QE processes in turn stash the list into backend-private memory. This
 * is the 'preassigned_oids' list.
 *
 * In a QE node, when we are about to create a new object, and assign an OID
 * for it, we look into the 'preassigned_oids' list to see if we had received
 * an OID to use for the named object from the master. Under normal
 * circumstances, we should have a pre-assigned OID for all objects created
 * in QEs, and the GetPreassigned*() functions will throw an error if we
 * don't.
 *
 * All in all, this provides a generic mechanism for DDL commands, to record
 * OIDs that are assigned for new objects in the master, transfer them to QE
 * nodes when the DDL command is dispatched, and for the QE nodes to use the
 * same, pre-assigned, OIDs for the objects.
 *
 * This same mechanism is used to preserve OIDs when upgrading a GPDB cluster
 * using pg_upgrade. pg_upgrade in PostgreSQL is using a set of global vars to
 * communicate the next OID for an object during upgrade, a strategy GPDB
 * doesn't employ due to the need for multiple OIDs for auxiliary objects.
 * pg_upgrade records the OIDs from the old cluster and inserts them into the
 * same 'preassigned_oids' list to restore them, that we use to assign specific
 * OIDs in a QE node at dispatch. Additionally, to ensure that object creation
 * that isn't bound by preassigned OIDs isn't consuming an OID that will later
 * in the restore process be preassigned, a separate list of all such OIDs is
 * maintained and queried before assigning a new non-preassigned OID.
