 * Called when a session has been idle for a while (waiting for the client

 * The expectation is that if the session is logged on, but nobody is sending us
 * work to do, we want to free up whatever resources we can. Usually it means
 * there is a human being at the other end of the connection, and that person
 * has walked away from their terminal, or just hasn't decided what to do next.
 * We could be idle for a very long time (many hours).
 *
 * Of course, freeing gangs means that the next time the user does send in an
 * SQL statement, we need to allocate gangs (at least the writer gang) to do
 * anything. This entails extra work, so we don't want to do this if we don't
 * think the session has gone idle.
 *
 * PS: Is there anything we can free up on the master (QD) side? I can't
 * think of anything.
