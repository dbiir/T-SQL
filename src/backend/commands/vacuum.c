/*
 * Processing of the vacuumStatement for given relid.
 *
 * The function is called by vacuumStatement once for each relation to vacuum.
 * In order to connect QD and QE work for vacuum, we employ a little
 * complicated mechanism here; we separate one relation vacuum process
 * to a separate steps, depending on the type of storage (heap/AO),
 * and perform each step in separate transactions, so that QD can open
 * a distributed transaction and embrace QE work inside it.  As opposed to
 * old postgres code, where one transaction is opened and closed for each
 * auxiliary relation, here a transaction processes them as a set starting
 * from the base relation.  This is the entry point of one base relation,
 * and QD makes some decision what kind of stage we perform, and tells it
 * to QE with vacstmt fields through dispatch.
 *
 * For heap VACUUM we disable two-phase commit, because we do not actually make
 * any logical changes to the tables. Even if a VACUUM transaction fails on one
 * of the QE segments, it should not matter, because the data has not logically
 * changed on disk. VACUUM FULL and lazy vacuum are both completed in one
 * transaction.
 *
 * AO compaction is rather complicated.  There are four phases.
 *   - prepare phase
 *   - compaction phase
 *   - drop phase
 *   - cleanup phase
 * Out of these, compaction and drop phase might repeat multiple times.
 * We go through the list of available segment files by looking up catalog,
 * and perform a compaction operation, which appends the whole segfile
 * to another available one, if the source segfile looks to be dirty enough.
 * If we find such one and perform compaction, the next step is drop. In
 * order to allow concurrent read it is required for the drop phase to
 * be a separate transaction.  We mark the segfile as an awaiting-drop
 * in the catalog, and the drop phase actually drops the segfile from the
 * disk.  There are some cases where we cannot drop the segfile immediately,
 * in which case we just skip it and leave the catalog to have awaiting-drop
 * state for this segfile.  Aside from the compaction and drop phases, the
 * rest is much simpler.  The prepare phase is to truncate unnecessary
 * blocks after the logical EOF, and the cleanup phase does normal heap
 * vacuum on auxiliary relations (toast, aoseg, block directory, visimap,)
 * as well as updating stats info in catalog.  Keep in mind that if the
 * vacuum is full, we need the same two steps as the heap base relation
 * case.  So cleanup phase in AO may consume two transactions.
 *
 * While executing these multiple transactions, we acquire a session
 * lock across transactions, in order to keep concurrent work on the
 * same relation away.  It doesn't look intuitive, though, if you look
 * at QE work, because from its perspective it is always one step, therefore
 * there is no session lock technically (we actually acquire and release
 * it as it's harmless.)  Session lock doesn't work here, because QE
 * is under a distributed transaction and we haven't supported session
 * lock recording in transaction prepare.  This should be ok as far as
 * we are dealing with user table, because other MPP work also tries
 * to take a relation lock, which would conflict with this vacuum work
 * on master.  Be careful with catalog tables, because we take locks on
 * them and release soon much before the end of transaction.  That means
 * QE still needs to deal with concurrent work well.

 *
 *		We violate transaction semantics here by overwriting the rel's

 *		safe as long as we're sure that the new values are correct whether or
 *		not this transaction commits.  The reason for doing this is that if
 *		we updated these tuples in the usual way, vacuuming pg_class itself
 *		wouldn't work very well --- by the time we got done with a vacuum
 *		cycle, most of the tuples in pg_class would've been obsoleted.  Of
 *		course, this only works for fixed-size not-null columns, but these are.
 *
 *		Another reason for doing it this way is that when we are in a lazy
 *		VACUUM and have PROC_IN_VACUUM set, we mustn't do any regular updates.
 *		Somebody vacuuming pg_class might think they could delete a tuple
 *		marked with xmin = our xid.
 *
 *		In addition to fundamentally nontransactional statistics such as
 *		relpages and relallvisible, we try to maintain certain lazily-updated
 *		DDL flags such as relhasindex, by clearing them if no longer correct.
 *		It's safe to do this in VACUUM, which can't run in parallel with
 *		CREATE INDEX/RULE/TRIGGER and can't be part of a transaction block.
 *		However, it's *not* safe to do it in an ANALYZE that's within an
 *		outer transaction, because for example the current transaction might
 *		have dropped the last index; then we'd think relhasindex should be
 *		cleared, but if the transaction later rolls back this would be wrong.
 *		So we refrain from updating the DDL flags if we're inside an outer
 *		transaction.  This is OK since postponing the flag maintenance is
 *		always allowable.

			 * full VACUUM is exactly that we may have to run user- defined

			 * they use the snapshot set above, any tuples it requires can't get
			 * removed from other tables.  An index function that depends on the
			 * contents of other tables is arguably broken, but we won't break it
			 * here by violating transaction semantics.)
			 *
			 * GPDB doesn't use PROC_IN_VACUUM, as lazy vacuum for bitmap
			 * indexed tables performs reindex causing updates to pg_class
			 * tuples for index entries.
			 *
			 * We also set the VACUUM_FOR_WRAPAROUND flag, which is passed down
			 * by autovacuum; it's used to avoid cancelling a vacuum that was
			 * invoked in an emergency.
			 *
			 * Note: this flag remains set until CommitTransaction or
