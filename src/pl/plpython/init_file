# Copied from src/test/regress/init_file:
#
# There are a number of NOTICE and HINT messages around table distribution,
# for example to inform the user that the database will pick a particular
# column in order to distribute the data. Merging tests from postgres will
# cause the tests to output these messages and we would need to manually
# modify the corresponding expected output. Hence we want to ignore these.
# Some of the messages include:
#
# NOTICE:  Table doesn't have 'DISTRIBUTED BY' clause -- Using column named '<colname>' as the Greenplum Database data distribution key for this table.
# NOTICE:  Table doesn't have 'DISTRIBUTED BY' clause, defaulting to distribution columns from LIKE table
# HINT:  The 'DISTRIBUTED BY' clause determines the distribution of data. Make sure column(s) chosen are the optimal data distribution key to minimize skew.
#
# The following regex is intended to cover all permutations of the above set
# of messages.
