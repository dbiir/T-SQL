ABOUT GP DEMO
******************************************************************

The GP demo program will setup a virtual Greenplum Database system
on a single host. It creates and starts a GP master instance and
three segment instances (three primary and three mirror segments)
within the same directory. Running GP demo is a good way to test
your initial installation before deploying the Greenplum Database
software on a multi-host array. It is also a good way to become
familiar with the system without investing the time involved in a
multi-host setup.

******************************************************************
BEFORE YOU BEGIN
******************************************************************

Before running GP demo, you must at least have 700 MB of free disk
space, and have the TCP ports 15432 and 25432 -  25443 free.

* Verify that your $USER environment variable is set. 

* Greenplum Database recommends using the bash shell to run the
  GP demo programs.

******************************************************************
RUNNING GP DEMO
******************************************************************

1. Login as the Greenplum designated user (i.e. 'gpadmin').

	su - gpadmin

2. Go into the gpdemo directory:

	cd gpAux/gpdemo

3. Source greenplum_path.sh

	. /usr/local/greenplum-db/greenplum_path.sh

   Note: There is a space between the dot and the slash.

   The "." will source the greenplum_path.sh into the current
   shell, instead of starting a subprocess.

4. Create the cluster:

	make cluster

5. If setup completes correctly, you will have a virtual Greenplum
   Database system running on the local host. You can connect to
   it using the psql client program as follows:

	psql -p 15432 postgres

7. To exit the psql client program:

	\q

8. See the Greenplum Database User Guide for more information on
   using your Greenplum Database system.


******************************************************************
REMOVING GP DEMO
******************************************************************

1. From the gpdemo directory run make clean:

	make clean

2. This will stop all Greenplum Database demo server processes
   and remove all files and directories created by the GP demo
   program.


******************************************************************
MODIFYING GP DEMO SETTINGS
******************************************************************

Certain parameters of the demo cluster are adjustable by setting
environment variables before initializing the cluster:

* Master TCP port:

	export MASTER_PORT=<new TCP port number>

* Base port for segments:

	export PORT_BASE=<new lowest TCP port number>

  The cluster will use the ports following the base port.

* Number of segments:

	export NUM_PRIMARY_MIRROR_PAIRS=<number segments>

  It is recommended to specify an odd number of segments, in order
  to catch problems with data distribution.

* Data directory:

	export DATADIRS=<path to directory>

  The data directories for the master and the segments will be
  created under the specified directory path.

* Turn fsync off:

	export BLDWRAP_POSTGRES_CONF_ADDONS="fsync=off"

  A temporary cluster might not need all the ACID data protection,
  therefore fsync can be turned off to speed up the disk I/O.

  Note: NEVER turn off fsync if you intend to run the cluster
        in production!
