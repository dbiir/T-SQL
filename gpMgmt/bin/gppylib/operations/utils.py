    """ 
    RemoteOperation communicates w/ gpoperation.py on the remote end, with the following assumptions.
    1) gppylib exists
    2) gpoperation.py can see gppylib as a top-level module
    3) obj is defined at the top level of its module
       This requirement actually arises out of an underlying pickle issue, which in turn, appears
       to result from a python class oddity. If class B is defined within class A, it does not consider
       A to be its module. B is merely a class that is an attribute of A. For this reason, once instantiated,
       B cannot be rebuilt from its module name and class name alone. Its outer class A is a missing piece
       of information that gppickle cannot attain from python internals.
    4) Most importantly, the operation provided here must be imported into the gppylib... namespace. Otherwise,
       gpoperation.py will be unable to deserialize and import it on the remote end.

       In the normal gppylib use case, some bin/ level script will use an absolute import to bring in something
       from gppylib. In this manner, any ensuing imports (even if they're relative) will still be imported into the
       gppylib namespace. Thus, pickling such objects over ssh to gpoperation.py will succeed, because such objects
       will be immediately importable on the remote end.

       However, there is exactly one edge case: unit testing. If a unit test is invoked directly through CLI, its objects
       reside in the __main__ module as opposed to gppylib.test_something. Again, this can be circumvented by invoking unit tests
       through PyUnit or python -m unittest, etc.
