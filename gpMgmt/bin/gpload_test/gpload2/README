The remote tests is intended to be run for remote server,
which means you are compiling loader package on local
machine but GPDB server is located on a separate machine.

To run this test, first source greenplum_path.sh in
greenplum-db-devel, not the greenplum-loaders-devel,
because loader package don't have the necessary diff tools.

Then setup necessary environment variables.
export PGHOST=127.0.0.1
export PGUSER=gpadmin
export PGPORT=15432

You can also use SSH to setup a tunnel and forward tcp
packet for you. This way the remote server will treat
the connection as a local connection. No need to modify
pg_hba.conf. Run the following command on GPDB server:

ssh -L8081:127.0.0.1:8081 -L8082:127.0.0.1:8082 \
    -R15432:127.0.0.1:15432 \
    gpadmin@test-machine

Or run the following command on test machine:

ssh -R8081:127.0.0.1:8081 -R8082:127.0.0.1:8082 \
    -L15432:127.0.0.1:15432 \
    gpadmin@server-machine

Finally start the test by:
python TEST_REMOTE.py

On AIX7, you need to run:
python_64 TEST_REMOTE.py
