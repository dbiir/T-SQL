COMMAND NAME: gpreload

Reloads Greenplum Database table data sorting the data 
based on specified columns. 

*****************************************************
SYNOPSIS
*****************************************************

gpreload -d <database> [-p <port>] 
   {-t |--table-file} <path_to_file>  [-a ]

gpreload -h | --version


*****************************************************
DESCRIPTION
*****************************************************

The gpreload utility reloads table data with column data sorted. For 
tables that were created with the table storage option APPENDONLY=TRUE 
and compression enabled, reloading the data with sorted data can improve 
table compression. You specify a list of tables to be reloaded the table 
column to be sorted in a text file. 

Compression is improved by sorting data when the data in the column has 
a relatively low number of distinct values when compared to the total 
number of rows. 

For a table being reloaded, the order of the columns to be sorted might 
affect compression. The columns with fewest distinct values should be 
listed first. For example, listing state then city would generally 
result in better compression than listing city then state. 

 public.cust_table: state, city
 public.cust_table: city, state

For information about the format of the file used with gpreload, see the 
--table-file option.


*****************************************************
NOTES
*****************************************************

To improve reload performance, indexes on tables being reloaded should 
be removed before reloading the data. 

Running the ANALYZE command after reloading table data might query 
performance because of a change in the data distribution of the reloaded 
data. 


*****************************************************
OPTIONS
*****************************************************

-a

 Optional. If specified, the gpreload utility does not prompt the user
 for confirmation. 

 
-d <database>

 The database that contains the tables to be reloaded. The gpreload 
 utility connects to the database as the user running the utility. 


-p <port> 

 The Greenplum Database master port. If not specified, the value of the 
 PGPORT environment variable is used. If the value is not available, an 
 error is returned. 

 
{-t | --table-file } <path_to_file> 

 The location and name of file containing list of schema qualified table 
 names to reload and the column names to reorder from the Greenplum 
 Database. Only user defined tables are supported. Views or system 
 catalog tables are not supported. 

 If indexes are defined on table listed in the file, gpreload prompts to 
 continue. 

 Each line specifies a table name and the list of columns to sort. This 
 is the format of each line in the file: 

  <schema>.<table_name>: <column> [desc] [, <column2> [desc] ... ]

 The table name is followed by a colon ( : ) and then at least one column 
 name. If you specify more than one column, separate the column names 
 with a comma. The columns are sorted in ascending order. Specify the 
 keyword desc after the column name to sort the column in descending 
 order. 

 Wildcard characters are not supported. 

 If there are errors in the file, gpreload reports the first error and 
 exits. No data is reloaded. 

 The following example reloads three tables. 

  public.clients: region, state, rep_id desc
  public.merchants: region, state
  test.lineitem: group, assy, whse 

 In the first table public.clients, the data in the rep_id column is 
 sorted in descending order. The data in the other columns are sorted in 
 ascending order. 


--version

 Displays the version of this utility.
