SYNOPSIS
*****************************************************

gpstate [-d <master_data_directory>] [-B <parallel_processes>] 
        [-s | -b | -Q | -e] [-m | -c] [-p] [-i] [-f]

*****************************************************
DESCRIPTION
*****************************************************

The gpstate utility displays information about a running 
Greenplum Database instance. There is additional information 
you may want to know about a Greenplum Database system, since 
it is comprised of multiple PostgreSQL database instances (segments) 
spanning multiple machines. The gpstate utility provides 
additional status information for a Greenplum Database system, 
such as:
* Which segments are down.
* Master and segment configuration information (hosts, 
  data directories, etc.).
* The ports used by the system.
* A mapping of primary segments to their corresponding 
  mirror segments.

*****************************************************
OPTIONS
*****************************************************

-b (brief status)

  Optional. Display a brief summary of the state of the 
  Greenplum Database system. This is the default option.


-B <parallel_processes>

  The number of segments to check in parallel. If not specified, 
  the utility will start up to 60 parallel processes depending on 
  how many segment instances it needs to check.


-c (show primary to mirror mappings)

  Optional. Display mapping of primary segments to their 
  corresponding mirror segments.


-d <master_data_directory>

  Optional. The master data directory. If not specified, the 
  value set for $MASTER_DATA_DIRECTORY will be used.


-e (show segments with mirror status issues)

  Show details on primary/mirror segment pairs that have 
  potential issues such as 1) the active segment is running in 
  change tracking mode, meaning a segment is down 2) the active 
  segment is in resynchronization mode, meaning it is catching 
  up changes to the mirror 3) a segment is not in its preferred role, 
  for example a segment that was a primary at system initialization 
  time is now acting as a mirror, meaning you may have one or more 
  segment hosts with unbalanced processing load.


-f (show standby master details)

  Display details of the standby master host if configured.


-i (show Greenplum Database version)
  
  Display the Greenplum Database software version information 
  for each instance.


-l <logfile_directory>

  The directory to write the log file. Defaults to ~/gpAdminLogs.


-m (list mirrors)
 
  Optional. List the mirror segment instances in the system, 
  their current role, and synchronization status.


-p (show ports)

  List the port numbers used throughout the Greenplum Database 
  system.


-x (expand)

  Optional. Display details of any current gpexpand.


-q (no screen output)

  Optional. Run in quiet mode. Except for warning messages, command 
  output is not displayed on the screen. However, this information 
  is still written to the log file.


-Q (quick status)

  Optional. Checks segment status in the system catalog on 
  the master host. Does not poll the segments for status.


-s (detailed status)

  Optional. Displays detailed status information for the 
  Greenplum Database system.


-v (verbose output)

  Optional. Displays error messages and outputs detailed status 
  and progress information.


-? | -h | --help (help)

  Displays the online help.


*****************************************************
OUTPUT DEFINITIONS FOR DETAIL VIEW
*****************************************************
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
MASTER OUTPUT DATA
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Master host - host name of the master

* Master postgres process ID - PID of the master postgres database 
                               listener process

* Master data directory - file system location of the master data directory

* Master port - port of the master database listener process

* Master current role - dispatch = regular operating mode 
                        utility = maintenance mode 

* Greenplum array configuration type - Standard = one NIC per host 
                                       Multi-Home = multiple NICs per host

* Greenplum initsystem version - version of Greenplum Database when 
                                 system was first initialized

* Greenplum current version - current version of Greenplum Database

* Postgres version - version of PostgreSQL that Greenplum Database 
                     is based on

* Greenplum mirroring status - physical mirroring, SAN or none

* Master standby - host name of the standby master

* Standby master state - status of the standby master: active or passive

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SEGMENT OUTPUT DATA
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Hostname - system-configured host name

* Address - network address host name (NIC name)

* Datadir - file system location of segment data directory

* Port - port number of segment postgres database listener process

* Current Role - current role of a segment: Mirror or Primary 

* Preferred Role - role at system initialization time: Mirror or Primary

* Mirror Status - status of a primary/mirror segment pair:
                Synchronized = data is up to date on both 
                Resynchronizing = data is currently being copied from one to the other
                Change Tracking = segment down and active segment is logging changes

* Change tracking data size - when in Change Tracking mode, the size of the change 
                            log file (may grow and shrink as compression is applied)

* Estimated total data to synchronize - when in Resynchronization mode, the estimated 
                                      size of data left to synchronize

* Data synchronized - when in Resynchronization mode, the estimated size of data 
                    that has already been synchronized

* Estimated resync progress with mirror - when in Resynchronization mode, the 
                                        estimated percentage of completion

* Estimated resync end time - when in Resynchronization mode, the estimated 
                            time to complete

* File postmaster.pid - status of postmaster.pid lock file: Found or Missing

* PID from postmaster.pid file - PID found in the postmaster.pid file

* Lock files in /tmp - a segment port lock file for its postgres process is 
                       created in /tmp (file is removed when a segment shuts down)

* Active PID - active process ID of a segment

* Master reports status as - segment status as reported in the system catalog: 
                           Up or Down

Database status - status of Greenplum Database to incoming requests: 
                Up, Down, or Suspended. A Suspended state means database 
                activity is temporarily paused while a segment transitions from 
                one state to another.
