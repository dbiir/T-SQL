The `pxf cluster status` command displays the status of the PXF service instance on all segment hosts in your Greenplum Database cluster. `pxf status` displays the status of the PXF service instance on the local (segment) host.

Only the `gpadmin` user can request the status of the PXF service.

Perform the following procedure to request the PXF status of your Greenplum Database cluster.

1. Log in to the Greenplum Database master node:

    ``` shell
    $ ssh gpadmin@<gpmaster>
    ```

2. Run the `pxf cluster status` command:

    ```shell
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ $GPHOME/pxf/bin/pxf cluster status
    ```
