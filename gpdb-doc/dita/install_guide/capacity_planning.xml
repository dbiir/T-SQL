  <shortdesc>To estimate how much data your Greenplum Database system can accommodate, use these
    measurements as guidelines. Also keep in mind that you may want to have extra space for landing
    backup files and data load files on each segment host. </shortdesc>

    <title id="jh159441">Calculating Usable Disk Capacity</title>
    <body>
      <p>To calculate how much data a Greenplum Database system can hold, you have to calculate the
        usable disk capacity per segment host and then multiply that by the number of segment hosts
        in your Greenplum Database array. Start with the raw capacity of the physical disks on a
        segment host that are available for data storage (<varname>raw_capacity</varname>), which
        is:</p>
      <codeblock><varname>disk_size</varname> * <varname>number_of_disks</varname></codeblock>
      <p>Account for file system formatting overhead (roughly 10 percent) and the RAID level you are
        using. For example, if using RAID-10, the calculation would be:</p>
      <codeblock>(<varname>raw_capacity</varname> * 0.9) / 2 = <varname>formatted_disk_space</varname></codeblock>
      <p>For optimal performance, do not completely fill your disks to capacity, but run at 70% or
        lower. So with this in mind, calculate the usable disk space as follows:</p>
      <codeblock><varname>formatted_disk_space</varname> * 0.7 = <varname>usable_disk_space</varname></codeblock>
      <p>Using only 70% of your disk space allows Greenplum Database to use the other 30% for
        temporary and transaction files on the same disks. If your host systems have a separate disk
        system that can be used for temporary and transaction files, you can specify a tablespace
        that Greenplum Database uses for the files. Moving the location of the files might improve
        performance depending on the performance of the disk system.</p>
      <p>Once you have formatted RAID disk arrays and accounted for the maximum recommended capacity
          (<varname>usable_disk_space</varname>), you will need to calculate how much storage is
        actually available for user data (<codeph>U</codeph>). If using Greenplum Database mirrors
        for data redundancy, this would then double the size of your user data (<codeph>2 *
          U</codeph>). Greenplum Database also requires some space be reserved as a working area for
        active queries. The work space should be approximately one third the size of your user data
        (work space =
        <codeph>U/3</codeph>):<codeblock><b>With mirrors:</b> (2 * U) + U/3 = <varname>usable_disk_space</varname>

<b>Without mirrors:</b> U + U/3 = <varname>usable_disk_space</varname></codeblock></p>
      <p>Guidelines for temporary file space and user data space assume a typical analytic workload.
        Highly concurrent workloads or workloads with queries that require very large amounts of
        temporary space can benefit from reserving a larger working area. Typically, overall system
        throughput can be increased while decreasing work area usage through proper workload
        management. Additionally, temporary space and user space can be isolated from each other by
        specifying that they reside on different tablespaces.</p>

    <title id="jh159695">Calculating User Data Size</title>
    <body>
      <p>As with all databases, the size of your raw data will be slightly larger once it is loaded
        into the database. On average, raw data will be about 1.4 times larger on disk after it is
        loaded into the database, but could be smaller or larger depending on the data types you are
        using, table storage type, in-database compression, and so on.</p>
      <ul>
        <li id="jh157686">Page Overhead - When your data is loaded into Greenplum Database, it is
          divided into pages of 32KB each. Each page has 20 bytes of page overhead.</li>
        <li id="jh157687">Row Overhead - In a regular 'heap' storage table, each row of data has 24
          bytes of row overhead. An 'append-optimized' storage table has only 4 bytes of row
          overhead.</li>
        <li id="jh157688">Attribute Overhead - For the data values itself, the size associated with
          each attribute value is dependent upon the data type chosen. As a general rule, you want
          to use the smallest data type possible to store your data (assuming you know the possible
          values a column will have).</li>
        <li id="jh157689">Indexes - In Greenplum Database, indexes are distributed across the
          segment hosts as is table data. The default index type in Greenplum Database is B-tree.
          Because index size depends on the number of unique values in the index and the data to be
          inserted, precalculating the exact size of an index is impossible. However, you can
          roughly estimate the size of an index using these
          formulas.<codeblock><b>B-tree:</b> <varname>unique_values</varname> * (<varname>data_type_size</varname> + 24 bytes)

<b>Bitmap:</b> (<varname>unique_values</varname> * <varname>number_of_rows</varname> * 1 bit * <varname>compression_ratio</varname> / 8) + (<varname>unique_values</varname> * 32)</codeblock></li>

    <title id="jh159741">Calculating Space Requirements for Metadata and Logs</title>
    <body>
      <p>On each segment host, you will also want to account for space for Greenplum Database log
        files and metadata:</p>
      <ul>
        <li id="jh159754"><b>System Metadata</b> — For each Greenplum Database segment instance
          (primary or mirror) or master instance running on a host, estimate approximately 20 MB for
          the system catalogs and metadata. </li>
        <li id="jh159758"><b>Write Ahead Log</b> — For each Greenplum Database segment (primary or
          mirror) or master instance running on a host, allocate space for the write ahead log
          (WAL). The WAL is divided into segment files of 64 MB each. At most, the number of WAL
          files will be: <codeblock>2 * <varname>checkpoint_segments</varname> + 1</codeblock><p>You
            can use this to estimate space requirements for WAL. The default
              <varname>checkpoint_segments</varname> setting for a Greenplum Database instance is 8,
            meaning 1088 MB WAL space allocated for each segment or master instance on a
          host.</p></li>
        <li id="jh159765"><b>Greenplum Database Log Files</b> — Each segment instance and the master
          instance generates database log files, which will grow over time. Sufficient space should
          be allocated for these log files, and some type of log rotation facility should be used to
          ensure that to log files do not grow too large. </li>
        <li id="jh160818"><b>Command Center Data</b> — The data collection agents utilized by
          Command Center run on the same set of hosts as your Greenplum Database instance and
          utilize the system resources of those hosts. The resource consumption of the data
          collection agent processes on these hosts is minimal and should not significantly impact
          database performance. Historical data collected by the collection agents is stored in its
          own Command Center database (named <codeph>gpperfmon</codeph>) within your Greenplum
          Database system. Collected data is distributed just like regular database data, so you
          will need to account for disk space in the data directory locations of your Greenplum
          segment instances. The amount of space required depends on the amount of historical data
          you would like to keep. Historical data is not automatically truncated. Database
          administrators must set up a truncation policy to maintain the size of the Command Center
          database.</li>
