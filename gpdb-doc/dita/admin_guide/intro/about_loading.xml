  <shortdesc>This topic provides a short introduction to Greenplum Database data loading
    features.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>In a large scale, multi-terabyte data warehouse, large amounts of data must be loaded within
      a relatively small maintenance window. Greenplum supports fast, parallel data loading with its
      external tables feature. Administrators can also load external tables in single row error
      isolation mode to filter bad rows into a separate error log while continuing to load
      properly formatted rows. Administrators can specify an error threshold for a load operation to
      control how many improperly formatted rows cause Greenplum to abort the load operation.</p>

    <p>By using external tables in conjunction with Greenplum Database's parallel file server
        (<codeph>gpfdist</codeph>), administrators can achieve maximum parallelism and load
      bandwidth from their Greenplum Database system.</p>

    <p>Another Greenplum utility, <codeph>gpload</codeph>, runs a load task that you specify in a
      YAML-formatted control file. You describe the source data locations, format, transformations
      required, participating hosts, database destinations, and other particulars in the control
      file and <codeph>gpload</codeph> executes the load. This allows you to describe a complex task
      and execute it in a controlled,  repeatable fashion. </p>
