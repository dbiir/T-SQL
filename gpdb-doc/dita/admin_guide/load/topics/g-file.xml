        <p>The <codeph>file://</codeph> protocol requires that the external data file(s) reside on a
            segment host in a location accessible by the Greenplum superuser
                (<codeph>gpadmin</codeph>). The number of URIs that you specify corresponds to the
            number of segment instances that will work in parallel to access the external table. For
            example, if you have a Greenplum Database system with 8 primary segments and you specify
            2 external files, only 2 of the 8 segments will access the external table in parallel at
            query time. The number of external files per segment host cannot exceed the number of
            primary segment instances on that host. For example, if your array has 4 primary segment
            instances per segment host, you can place 4 external files on each segment host. The
            host name used in the URI must match the segment host name as registered in the
                <i>gp_segment_configuration</i> system catalog table. Tables based on the
                <codeph>file://</codeph> protocol can only be readable tables.</p>
        <p>The system view <codeph>pg_max_external_files</codeph> shows how many external table
            files are permitted per external table. This view lists the available file slots per
            segment host when using the <codeph>file://</codeph> protocol. The view is only
            applicable for the <codeph>file://</codeph> protocol. For example:</p>
        <p>
            <codeblock>SELECT * FROM pg_max_external_files;
</codeblock>
        </p>
