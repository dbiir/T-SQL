   <title>Escaping</title>
   <body>
      <p>There are two reserved characters that have special meaning to Greenplum Database:</p>
      <ul>
         <li id="du174909">The designated delimiter character separates columns or fields in the
            data file. </li>
         <li id="du174910">The newline character designates a new row in the data file.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your data contains either of these characters, you must escape the character so that
            Greenplum treats it as data and not as a field separator or
         new row. By default, the escape character is a \ (backslash) for text-formatted files and a
         double quote (") for csv-formatted files.</p>
