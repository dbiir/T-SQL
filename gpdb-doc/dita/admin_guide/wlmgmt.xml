  <shortdesc>Greenplum Database provides features to help you prioritize and allocate resources to
    queries according to business requirements and to prevent queries from starting when resources
    are unavailable.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>You can use resource management features to limit the number of concurrent queries, the
      amount of memory used to execute a query, and the relative amount of CPU devoted to processing
      a query. Greenplum Database provides two schemes to manage resources - Resource Queues and
      Resource Groups.</p>
    <note type="important">Significant Greenplum Database performance degradation has been observed
      when enabling resource group-based workload management on RedHat 6.x and CentOS 6.x. This
      issue is caused by a Linux cgroup kernel bug. This kernel bug has been fixed in CentOS 7.x and
      Red Hat 7.x systems. <p>If you use RedHat 6 and the performance with resource groups is
        acceptable for your use case, upgrade your kernel to version 2.6.32-696 or higher to benefit
        from other fixes to the cgroups implementation. </p></note>
    <p>Either the resource queue or the resource group management scheme can be active in Greenplum
      Database; both schemes cannot be active at the same time.</p>
    <p>Resource queues are enabled by default when you install your Greenplum Database cluster.
      While you can create and assign resource groups when resource queues are active, you must
      explicitly enable resource groups to start using that management scheme.</p>
    <p>The following table summarizes some of the differences between Resource Queues and Resource
      Groups.</p>
