  <title id="kg1382433">About the Greenplum Database Release Version Number</title>
  <shortdesc>Greenplum Database version numbers and they way they change identify
    what has been modified from one Greenplum Database release to the next.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>A Greenplum Database release version number takes the format
      <varname>x.y.z</varname>, where:
      <ul>
        <li><varname>x</varname> identifies the Major version number</li>
        <li><varname>y</varname> identifies the Minor version number</li>
        <li><varname>z</varname> identifies the Patch version number</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Greenplum Database releases that have the same Major release number are 
      guaranteed to be backwards compatible. Greenplum Database increments the
      Major release number when the catalog changes or when incompatible feature
      changes or new features are introduced. Previously deprecated functionality
      may be removed in a major release.</p>
    <p>The Minor release number for a given Major release increments when 
      backwards compatible new features are introduced or when a Greenplum Database
      feature is deprecated. (Previously deprecated functionality will never be
      removed in a minor release.)</p>
    <p>Greenplum Database increments the Patch release number for a given Minor
      release for backwards-compatible bug fixes.</p>
