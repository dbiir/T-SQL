  <shortdesc>This section covers data definition language (DDL) in Greenplum Database
    and how to create and manage database objects.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>Creating objects in a Greenplum Database includes making up-front choices about
      data distribution, storage options, data loading, and other Greenplum features that will affect the ongoing performance of your
      database system. Understanding the options that are available and how the database will be
      used will help you make the right decisions. </p>
    <p>Most of the advanced Greenplum features are enabled with extensions to the SQL
        <codeph>CREATE</codeph> DDL statements. </p>
