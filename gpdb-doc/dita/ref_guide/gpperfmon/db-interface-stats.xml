      <p>The <codeph>interface_stats_*</codeph> tables store statistical metrics about
         communications over each active interface for a Greenplum Database instance.</p>
      <p>These tables are in place for future use and are not currently populated.</p>
      <p>There are three <codeph>interface_stats</codeph> tables, all having the same columns:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <codeph>interface_stats_now</codeph> is an external table whose data files are stored in
               <codeph>$MASTER_DATA_DIRECTORY/gpperfmon/data</codeph>.</li>
         <li>
            <codeph>interface_stats_tail</codeph> is an external table whose data files are stored
            in <codeph>$MASTER_DATA_DIRECTORY/gpperfmon/data</codeph>. This is a transitional table
            for statistical interface metrics that has been cleared from
               <codeph>interface_stats_now</codeph> but has not yet been committed to
               <codeph>interface_stats_history</codeph>. It typically only contains a few minutes
            worth of data.</li>
         <li>
            <codeph>interface_stats_history</codeph> is a regular table that stores statistical
            interface metrics. It is pre-partitioned into monthly partitions. Partitions are
            automatically added in one month increments as needed. </li>
      </ul>
