in the current transaction. </p><p>Destroying a savepoint makes it unavailable as a rollback point, but it has no other user visible
        behavior. It does not undo the effects of commands executed after the savepoint was
        established. (To do that, see <codeph><xref href="./ROLLBACK_TO_SAVEPOINT.xml#topic1"
            type="topic" format="dita"/></codeph>.) Destroying a savepoint when it is no longer
        needed may allow the system to reclaim some resources earlier than transaction end. </p><p><codeph>RELEASE SAVEPOINT</codeph> also destroys all savepoints that were established
          <i>after</i> the named savepoint was established.</p></section><section id="section4"><title>Parameters</title><parml><plentry><pt><varname>savepoint_name</varname></pt><pd>The name of the savepoint to destroy.</pd></plentry></parml></section><section id="section5"><title>Examples</title><p>To establish and later destroy a savepoint:</p><codeblock>BEGIN;
