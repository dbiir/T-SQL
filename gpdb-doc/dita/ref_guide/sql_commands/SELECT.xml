      <title>Description</title>
      <p><codeph>SELECT</codeph> retrieves rows from zero or more tables. The general processing of
          <codeph>SELECT</codeph> is as follows: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>All queries in the <codeph>WITH</codeph> clause are computed. These effectively serve as
          temporary tables that can be referenced in the <codeph>FROM</codeph> list. </li>
        <li id="eg138796">All elements in the <codeph>FROM</codeph> list are computed. (Each element
          in the <codeph>FROM</codeph> list is a real or virtual table.) If more than one element is
          specified in the <codeph>FROM</codeph> list, they are cross-joined together.</li>
        <li id="eg138832">If the <codeph>WHERE</codeph> clause is specified, all rows that do not
          satisfy the condition are eliminated from the output.</li>
        <li id="eg138840">If the <codeph>GROUP BY</codeph> clause is specified, or if there are
          aggregate function calls, the output is combined into groups of rows that match on one or
          more values, and the results of aggregate functions are computed. If the
            <codeph>HAVING</codeph> clause is present, it eliminates groups that do not satisfy the
          given condition.</li>
        <li>The actual output rows are computed using the <codeph>SELECT</codeph> output expressions
          for each selected row or row group. </li>
        <li><codeph>SELECT DISTINCT</codeph> eliminates duplicate rows from the result.
            <codeph>SELECT DISTINCT ON</codeph> eliminates rows that match on all the specified
          expressions. <codeph>SELECT ALL</codeph> (the default) will return all candidate rows,
          including duplicates. </li>
        <li id="eg141787">If a window expression is specified (and optional <codeph>WINDOW</codeph>
          clause), the output is organized according to the positional (row) or value-based (range)
          window frame.</li>
        <li id="eg138848">The actual output rows are computed using the <codeph>SELECT</codeph>
          output expressions for each selected row.</li>

        <li id="eg138856">Using the operators <codeph>UNION</codeph>, <codeph>INTERSECT</codeph>,
          and <codeph>EXCEPT</codeph>, the output of more than one <codeph>SELECT</codeph> statement
          can be combined to form a single result set. The <codeph>UNION</codeph> operator returns
          all rows that are in one or both of the result sets. The <codeph>INTERSECT</codeph>
          operator returns all rows that are strictly in both result sets. The
            <codeph>EXCEPT</codeph> operator returns the rows that are in the first result set but
          not in the second. In all three cases, duplicate rows are eliminated unless
            <codeph>ALL</codeph> is specified. The noise word <codeph>DISTINCT</codeph> can be added
          to explicitly specify eliminating duplicate rows. Notice that <codeph>DISTINCT</codeph> is
          the default behavior here, even though <codeph>ALL</codeph> is the default for
            <codeph>SELECT</codeph> itself. </li>
        <li id="eg138864">If the <codeph>ORDER BY</codeph> clause is specified, the returned rows
          are sorted in the specified order. If <codeph>ORDER BY</codeph> is not given, the rows are
          returned in whatever order the system finds fastest to produce.</li>
        <li id="eg138878">If the <codeph>LIMIT</codeph> (or <codeph>FETCH FIRST</codeph>) or
            <codeph>OFFSET</codeph> clause is specified, the <codeph>SELECT</codeph> command only
          returns a subset of the result rows.</li>
        <li id="eg138885">If you specify a locking clause <codeph>FOR {UPDATE</codeph>|<codeph>NO
            KEY UPDATE</codeph>|<codeph>SHARE</codeph>|<codeph>KEY SHARE}</codeph>, the
            <codeph>SELECT</codeph> command locks the entire table against concurrent updates when
          the Global Deadlock Detector is disabled (the default). When the Global Deadlock Detector
          is enabled, it affects some simple <codeph>SELECT</codeph> statements that contain a
          locking clause.<p>For information about using a <codeph>FOR</codeph> clause and the effect
            of the Global Deadlock Detector, see "The Locking Clause" later in this
          section.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <p>You must have <codeph>SELECT</codeph> privilege on each column used in a
          <codeph>SELECT</codeph> command. The use of <codeph>FOR NO KEY UPDATE</codeph>,
          <codeph>FOR UPDATE</codeph>, <codeph>FOR SHARE</codeph>, or <codeph>FOR KEY SHARE</codeph>
        requires <codeph>UPDATE</codeph> privilege as well (for at least one column of each table so
        selected).</p>

      <sectiondiv>
        <b>The WITH Clause</b>
        <p>The optional <codeph>WITH</codeph> clause allows you to specify one or more subqueries
          that can be referenced by name in the primary query. The subqueries effectively act as
          temporary tables or views for the duration of the primary query. Each subquery can be a
            <codeph>SELECT</codeph>, <codeph>INSERT</codeph>, <codeph>UPDATE</codeph>, or
            <codeph>DELETE</codeph> statement. When writing a data-modifying statement
            (<codeph>INSERT</codeph>, <codeph>UPDATE</codeph>, or <codeph>DELETE</codeph>) in
            <codeph>WITH</codeph>, it is usual to include a <codeph>RETURNING</codeph> clause. It is
          the output of <codeph>RETURNING</codeph>, <i>not</i> the underlying table that the
          statement modifies, that forms the temporary table that is read by the primary query. If
            <codeph>RETURNING</codeph> is omitted, the statement is still executed, but it produces
          no output so it cannot be referenced as a table by the primary query. </p><p>For a <codeph>SELECT</codeph> command that includes a
            <codeph>WITH</codeph> clause, the clause can contain at most a single clause that
          modifies table data (<codeph>INSERT</codeph>, <codeph>UPDATE</codeph> or
            <codeph>DELETE</codeph> command).</p><p>A
            <varname>with_query_name</varname> without schema qualification must be specified for
          each query in the <codeph>WITH</codeph> clause. Optionally, a list of column names can be
          specified; if the list of column names is omitted, the names are inferred from the
          subquery. The primary query and the <codeph>WITH</codeph> queries are all (notionally)
          executed at the same time. </p><p>If <codeph>RECURSIVE</codeph> is specified, it
          allows a <codeph>SELECT</codeph> subquery to reference itself by name. Such a subquery has
          the general
          form</p><codeblock><varname>non_recursive_term</varname> UNION [ALL | DISTINCT] <varname>recursive_term</varname></codeblock><p>where
          the recursive self-reference appears on the right-hand side of the <codeph>UNION</codeph>.
          Only one recursive self-reference is permitted per query. Recursive data-modifying
          statements are not supported, but you can use the results of a recursive
            <codeph>SELECT</codeph> query in a data-modifying statement.</p><p>If the
            <codeph>RECURSIVE</codeph> keyword is specified, the <codeph>WITH</codeph> queries need
          not be ordered: a query can reference another query that is later in the list. However,
          circular references, or mutual recursion, are not supported. </p><p>Without the
            <codeph>RECURSIVE</codeph> keyword, <codeph>WITH</codeph> queries can only reference
          sibling <codeph>WITH</codeph> queries that are earlier in the <codeph>WITH</codeph>
          list.</p><p><codeph>WITH RECURSIVE</codeph> limitations. These items are not
          supported:</p><ul id="ul_b21_szt_n1b">
          <li>A recursive <codeph>WITH</codeph> clause that contains the following in the
              <varname>recursive_term</varname>. <ul id="ul_c1b_nhf_p1b">
              <li>Subqueries with a self-reference</li>
              <li><codeph>DISTINCT</codeph> clause</li>
              <li><codeph>GROUP BY</codeph> clause</li>
              <li>A window function</li>
            </ul></li>
          <li>A recursive <codeph>WITH</codeph> clause where the <varname>with_query_name</varname>
            is a part of a set operation.</li>
        </ul><p>Following is an example of the set operation limitation. This query returns an error
          because the set operation <codeph>UNION</codeph> contains a reference to the table
            <codeph>foo</codeph>.
          <codeblock>WITH RECURSIVE foo(i) AS (
    SELECT 1
  UNION ALL
    SELECT i+1 FROM (SELECT * FROM foo UNION SELECT 0) bar
)
SELECT * FROM foo LIMIT 5;</codeblock></p><p>This
          recursive CTE is allowed because the set operation <codeph>UNION</codeph> does not have a
          reference to the CTE
          <codeph>foo</codeph>.<codeblock>WITH RECURSIVE foo(i) AS (
    SELECT 1
  UNION ALL
    SELECT i+1 FROM (SELECT * FROM bar UNION SELECT 0) bar, foo
    WHERE foo.i = bar.a
)
SELECT * FROM foo LIMIT 5;</codeblock></p>
        <p>A key property of <codeph>WITH</codeph> queries is that they are evaluated only once per
          execution of the primary query, even if the primary query refers to them more than once.
          In particular, data-modifying statements are guaranteed to be executed once and only once,
          regardless of whether the primary query reads all or any of their output.</p>
        <p>The primary query and the <codeph>WITH</codeph> queries are all (notionally) executed at
          the same time. This implies that the effects of a data-modifying statement in
            <codeph>WITH</codeph> cannot be seen from other parts of the query, other than by
          reading its <codeph>RETURNING</codeph> output. If two such data-modifying statements
          attempt to modify the same row, the results are unspecified. </p>

        <b>The SELECT List</b>
        <p>The <codeph>SELECT</codeph> list (between the key words <codeph>SELECT</codeph> and
            <codeph>FROM</codeph>) specifies expressions that form the output rows of the
            <codeph>SELECT</codeph> statement. The expressions can (and usually do) refer to columns
          computed in the <codeph>FROM</codeph> clause. </p><p>An <varname>expression</varname> in
          the <codeph>SELECT</codeph> list can be a constant value, a column reference, an operator
          invocation, a function call, an aggregate expression, a window expression, a scalar
          subquery, and so on. A number of constructs can be classified as an expression but do not
          follow any general syntax rules. These generally have the semantics of a function or
          operator. For information about SQL value expressions and function calls, see "Querying
          Data" in the <i>Greenplum Database Administrator Guide</i>.</p><p>Just as in a table,
          every output column of a <codeph>SELECT</codeph> has a name. In a simple
            <codeph>SELECT</codeph> this name is just used to label the column for display, but when
          the <codeph>SELECT</codeph> is a sub-query of a larger query, the name is seen by the
          larger query as the column name of the virtual table produced by the sub-query. To specify
          the name to use for an output column, write <codeph>AS</codeph>
          <varname>output_name</varname> after the column's expression. (You can omit
            <codeph>AS</codeph>, but only if the desired output name does not match any SQL keyword.
          For protection against possible future keyword additions, you can always either write
            <codeph>AS</codeph> or double-quote the output name.) If you do not specify a column
          name, Greenplum Database chooses a name is automatically. If the column's expression is a
          simple column reference then the chosen name is the same as that column's name. In more
          complex cases, a function or type name may be used, or the system may fall back on a
          generated name such as <codeph>?column?</codeph> or
            <codeph>column<varname>N</varname></codeph>. </p><p>An output column's name can be used to
          refer to the column's value in <codeph>ORDER BY</codeph> and <codeph>GROUP BY</codeph>
          clauses, but not in the <codeph>WHERE</codeph> or <codeph>HAVING</codeph> clauses; there
          you must write out the expression instead.</p><p>Instead of an expression,
            <codeph>*</codeph> can be written in the output list as a shorthand for all the columns
          of the selected rows. Also, you can write <codeph><varname>table_name</varname>.*</codeph>
          as a shorthand for the columns coming from just that table. In these cases it is not
          possible to specify new names with <codeph>AS</codeph>; the output column names will be
          the same as the table columns' names.</p></sectiondiv>
      <sectiondiv><b>The DISTINCT Clause</b>
        <p>If <codeph>SELECT DISTINCT</codeph> is specified, all duplicate rows are removed from the
          result set (one row is kept from each group of duplicates). <codeph>SELECT ALL</codeph>
          specifies the opposite: all rows are kept; that is the default. </p>
        <p>
          <codeph>SELECT DISTINCT ON ( <varname>expression</varname> [, ...] )</codeph> keeps only
          the first row of each set of rows where the given expressions evaluate to equal. The
            <codeph>DISTINCT ON</codeph> expressions are interpreted using the same rules as for
            <codeph>ORDER BY</codeph> (see above). Note that the "first row" of each set is
          unpredictable unless <codeph>ORDER BY</codeph> is used to ensure that the desired row
          appears first. For example:
          <codeblock>
SELECT DISTINCT ON (location) location, time, report
    FROM weather_reports
    ORDER BY location, time DESC;
</codeblock>
          retrieves the most recent weather report for each location. But if we had not used
            <codeph>ORDER BY</codeph> to force descending order of time values for each location,
          we'd have gotten a report from an unpredictable time for each location. </p>
          
        <p> The <codeph>DISTINCT ON</codeph> expression(s) must match the leftmost <codeph>ORDER
            BY</codeph> expression(s). The <codeph>ORDER BY</codeph> clause will normally contain
          additional expression(s) that determine the desired precedence of rows within each
            <codeph>DISTINCT ON</codeph> group. </p>
      </sectiondiv>
      <sectiondiv id="section6"><b>The FROM Clause</b><p>The <codeph>FROM</codeph> clause specifies
          one or more source tables for the <codeph>SELECT</codeph>. If multiple sources are
          specified, the result is the Cartesian product (cross join) of all the sources. But
          usually qualification conditions are added (via <codeph>WHERE</codeph>) to restrict the
          returned rows to a small subset of the Cartesian product. The <codeph>FROM</codeph> clause
          can contain the following elements: </p><parml>
          <plentry>
            <pt><varname>table_name</varname></pt>
            <pd>The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing table or view. If
                <codeph>ONLY</codeph> is specified, only that table is scanned. If
                <codeph>ONLY</codeph> is not specified, the table and all its descendant tables (if
              any) are scanned.</pd>
          </plentry>
          <plentry>
            <pt><varname>alias</varname></pt>
            <pd>A substitute name for the <codeph>FROM</codeph> item containing the alias. An alias
              is used for brevity or to eliminate ambiguity for self-joins (where the same table is
              scanned multiple times). When an alias is provided, it completely hides the actual
              name of the table or function; for example given <codeph>FROM foo AS f</codeph>, the
              remainder of the <codeph>SELECT</codeph> must refer to this <codeph>FROM</codeph> item
              as <codeph>f</codeph> not <codeph>foo</codeph>. If an alias is written, a column alias
              list can also be written to provide substitute names for one or more columns of the
              table.</pd>
          </plentry>
          <plentry>
            <pt><varname>select</varname></pt>

              clause that creates aggregate subtotals that roll up from the most detailed level to a
              grand total, following a list of grouping columns (or expressions).
                <codeph>ROLLUP</codeph> takes an ordered list of grouping columns, calculates the
              standard aggregate values specified in the <codeph>GROUP BY</codeph> clause, then

              thought of as a series of grouping sets. For example:</pd>
            <pd>
              <codeblock>GROUP BY ROLLUP (a,b,c) </codeblock>

              This allows precise specification across multiple dimensions without computing a whole
                <codeph>ROLLUP</codeph> or <codeph>CUBE</codeph>. For example:</pd>

                <codeph>CUBE</codeph>, or <codeph>GROUPING SETS</codeph>, two challenges arise.
              First, how do you determine which result rows are subtotals, and then the exact level

              that contain both stored <codeph>NULL</codeph> values and "NULL" values created by the
                <codeph>ROLLUP</codeph> or <codeph>CUBE</codeph>. Secondly, when duplicate grouping
              sets are specified in the <codeph>GROUP BY</codeph> clause, how do you determine which
              result rows are duplicates? There are two additional grouping functions you can use in
              the <codeph>SELECT</codeph> list to help with this:<ul id="ul_vx1_3ml_m4">

                  distinguishing a "NULL" representing the set of all values in a super-aggregated
                  row from a <codeph>NULL</codeph> value in a regular row. Each argument in this

                    <codeph>1</codeph> means the result row is super-aggregated, and
                    <codeph>0</codeph> means the result row is from a regular grouping. The
                    <codeph>grouping</codeph> function returns an integer by treating these bits as

                PRECEDING</codeph> is not allowed. </pd>
            <pd>The default framing option is <codeph>RANGE UNBOUNDED PRECEDING</codeph>, which is
              the same as <codeph>RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW</codeph>; it
              sets the frame to be all rows from the partition start up through the current row's

                BY</codeph> considers equivalent to the current row, or all rows if there
                is no <codeph>ORDER BY</codeph>). In general, <codeph>UNBOUNDED PRECEDING</codeph> means
              that the frame starts with the first row of the partition, and similarly
                <codeph>UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING</codeph> means that the frame ends with the last row of
              the partition (regardless of <codeph>RANGE</codeph> or <codeph>ROWS</codeph> mode). In
                <codeph>ROWS</codeph> mode, <codeph>CURRENT ROW</codeph> means that the frame starts
              or ends with the current row; but in <codeph>RANGE</codeph> mode it means that the
              frame starts or ends with the current row's first or last peer in the <codeph>ORDER
                BY</codeph> ordering. The <varname>value</varname>
              <codeph>PRECEDING</codeph> and <varname>value</varname>
              <codeph>FOLLOWING</codeph> cases are currently only allowed in <codeph>ROWS</codeph>
              mode. They indicate that the frame starts or ends with the row that many rows before
              or after the current row. <varname>value</varname> must be an integer expression not
              containing any variables, aggregate functions, or window functions. The value must not
              be null or negative; but it can be zero, which selects the current row itself. </pd>
            <pd>Beware that the <codeph>ROWS</codeph> options can produce unpredictable results if
              the <codeph>ORDER BY</codeph> ordering does not order the rows uniquely. The
                <codeph>RANGE</codeph> options are designed to ensure that rows that are peers in
              the <codeph>ORDER BY</codeph> ordering are treated alike; all peer rows will be in the
              same frame. </pd>
            <pd>Use either a <codeph>ROWS</codeph> or <codeph>RANGE</codeph> clause to express the
              bounds of the window. The window bound can be one, many, or all rows of a partition.
              You can express the bound of the window either in terms of a range of data values
              offset from the value in the current row (<codeph>RANGE</codeph>), or in terms of the
              number of rows offset from the current row (<codeph>ROWS</codeph>). When using the
                <codeph>RANGE</codeph> clause, you must also use an <codeph>ORDER BY</codeph>
              clause. This is because the calculation performed to produce the window requires that
              the values be sorted. Additionally, the <codeph>ORDER BY</codeph> clause cannot
              contain more than one expression, and the expression must result in either a date or a
              numeric value. When using the <codeph>ROWS</codeph> or <codeph>RANGE</codeph> clauses,
              if you specify only a starting row, the current row is used as the last row in the
              window.</pd>
            <pd><b>PRECEDING</b> — The <codeph>PRECEDING</codeph> clause defines the first row of
              the window using the current row as a reference point. The starting row is expressed
              in terms of the number of rows preceding the current row. For example, in the case of
                <codeph>ROWS</codeph> framing, <codeph>5 PRECEDING</codeph> sets the window to start
              with the fifth row preceding the current row. In the case of <codeph>RANGE</codeph>
              framing, it sets the window to start with the first row whose ordering column value
              precedes that of the current row by 5 in the given order. If the specified order is
              ascending by date, this will be the first row within 5 days before the current row.
                <codeph>UNBOUNDED PRECEDING</codeph> sets the first row in the window to be the
              first row in the partition.</pd>
            <pd><b>BETWEEN</b> — The <codeph>BETWEEN</codeph> clause defines the first and last row
              of the window, using the current row as a reference point. First and last rows are
              expressed in terms of the number of rows preceding and following the current row,
              respectively. For example, <codeph>BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND 5 FOLLOWING</codeph> sets
              the window to start with the third row preceding the current row, and end with the
              fifth row following the current row. Use <codeph>BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND
                UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING</codeph> to set the first and last rows in the window to be the
              first and last row in the partition, respectively. This is equivalent to the default
              behavior if no <codeph>ROW</codeph> or <codeph>RANGE</codeph> clause is
              specified.</pd>
            <pd><b>FOLLOWING</b> — The <codeph>FOLLOWING</codeph> clause defines the last row of the
              window using the current row as a reference point. The last row is expressed in terms
              of the number of rows following the current row. For example, in the case of
                <codeph>ROWS</codeph> framing, <codeph>5 FOLLOWING</codeph> sets the window to end
              with the fifth row following the current row. In the case of <codeph>RANGE</codeph>
              framing, it sets the window to end with the last row whose ordering column value
              follows that of the current row by 5 in the given order. If the specified order is
              ascending by date, this will be the last row within 5 days after the current row. Use
                <codeph>UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING</codeph> to set the last row in the window to be the
              last row in the partition.</pd>
            <pd>If you do not specify a <codeph>ROW</codeph> or a <codeph>RANGE</codeph> clause, the
              window bound starts with the first row in the partition (<codeph>UNBOUNDED

          operator is a less-than or greater-than operator.</p><p>Note that ordering options apply
          only to the expression they follow; for example <codeph>ORDER BY x, y DESC</codeph> does
          not mean the same thing as <codeph>ORDER BY x DESC, y

          as needed by including a <codeph>COLLATE</codeph> clause in the

      <sectiondiv><b>The LIMIT Clause</b><p>The <codeph>LIMIT</codeph> clause consists of two
          independent
          sub-clauses:</p><codeblock>LIMIT {<varname>count</varname> | ALL}
OFFSET <varname>start</varname></codeblock><p>where
            <varname>count</varname> specifies the maximum number of rows to return, while
            <varname>start</varname> specifies the number of rows to skip before starting to return
          rows. When both are specified, start rows are skipped before starting to count the
            <codeph>count</codeph> rows to be returned. </p><p>If the <codeph>count</codeph>
          expression evaluates to NULL, it is treated as <codeph>LIMIT ALL</codeph>, that is, no
          limit. If <codeph>start</codeph> evaluates to NULL, it is treated the same as
            <codeph>OFFSET 0</codeph>.</p><p>SQL:2008 introduced a different syntax to achieve the
          same result, which Greenplum Database also supports. It is:
          <codeblock>OFFSET <varname>start</varname> [ ROW | ROWS ]
            FETCH { FIRST | NEXT } [ <varname>count</varname> ] { ROW | ROWS } ONLY</codeblock></p><p>In this syntax, the <varname>start</varname>
              or <varname>count</varname> value is required by
              the standard to be a literal constant, a parameter, or a variable name;
              as a Greenplum Database extension, other expressions
              are allowed, but will generally need to be enclosed in parentheses to avoid
              ambiguity.
              If <varname>count</varname> is
              omitted in a <codeph>FETCH</codeph> clause, it defaults to 1.            
            <codeph>ROW</codeph> and <codeph>ROWS</codeph> as well as <codeph>FIRST</codeph> and
            <codeph>NEXT</codeph> are noise words that don't influence the effects of these clauses.
          According to the standard, the <codeph>OFFSET</codeph> clause must come before the
            <codeph>FETCH</codeph> clause if both are present; but Greenplum Database allows either
          order.</p><p>When using <codeph>LIMIT</codeph>, it is a good idea to use an <codeph>ORDER
            BY</codeph> clause that constrains the result rows into a unique order. Otherwise you
          will get an unpredictable subset of the query's rows — you may be asking for the tenth
          through twentieth rows, but tenth through twentieth in what ordering? You don't know what
          ordering unless you specify <codeph>ORDER BY</codeph>. </p><p>The query optimizer takes
            <codeph>LIMIT</codeph> into account when generating a query plan, so you are very likely
          to get different plans (yielding different row orders) depending on what you use for
            <codeph>LIMIT</codeph> and <codeph>OFFSET</codeph>. Thus, using different
            <codeph>LIMIT/OFFSET</codeph> values to select different subsets of a query result will
          give inconsistent results unless you enforce a predictable result ordering with
            <codeph>ORDER BY</codeph>. This is not a defect; it is an inherent consequence of the
          fact that SQL does not promise to deliver the results of a query in any particular order
          unless <codeph>ORDER BY</codeph> is used to constrain the order.</p></sectiondiv>

            <codeph>UPDATE</codeph> operations on heap tables. When the Global Deadlock Detector is

            scope="external">Explicit Locking</xref> in the PostgreSQL documentation.</p><p>To
          prevent the operation from waiting for other transactions to commit, use the
            <codeph>NOWAIT</codeph> option. With <codeph>NOWAIT</codeph>, the statement reports an
          error, rather than waiting, if a selected row cannot be locked immediately. Note that
            <codeph>NOWAIT</codeph> applies only to the row-level lock(s) — the required <codeph>ROW
            SHARE</codeph> table-level lock is still taken in the ordinary way. You can use LOCK
          with the <codeph>NOWAIT</codeph> option first, if you need to acquire the table-level lock
          without waiting.</p><p>If specific tables are named in a locking clause, then only rows
          coming from those tables are locked; any other tables used in the <codeph>SELECT</codeph>
          are simply read as usual. A locking clause without a table list affects all tables used in
          the statement. If a locking clause is applied to a view or sub-query, it affects all
          tables used in the view or sub-query. However, these clauses do not apply to
            <codeph>WITH</codeph> queries referenced by the primary query. If you want row locking
          to occur within a <codeph>WITH</codeph> query, specify a locking clause within the
            <codeph>WITH</codeph> query.</p><p>Multiple locking clauses can be written if it is
          necessary to specify different locking behavior for different tables. If the same table is
          mentioned (or implicitly affected) by both more than one locking clause, then it is
          processed as if it was only specified by the strongest one. Similarly, a table is
          processed as <codeph>NOWAIT</codeph> if that is specified in any of the clauses affecting
          it.</p><p>The locking clauses cannot be used in contexts where returned rows cannot be
          clearly identified with individual table rows; for example they cannot be used with
          aggregation.</p><p>When a locking clause appears at the top level of a
            <codeph>SELECT</codeph> query, the rows that are locked are exactly those that are
          returned by the query; in the case of a join query, the rows locked are those that
          contribute to returned join rows. In addition, rows that satisfied the query conditions as
          of the query snapshot will be locked, although they will not be returned if they were
          updated after the snapshot and no longer satisfy the query conditions. If a
            <codeph>LIMIT</codeph> is used, locking stops once enough rows have been returned to
          satisfy the limit (but note that rows skipped over by <codeph>OFFSET</codeph> will get
          locked). Similarly, if a locking clause is used in a cursor's query, only rows actually
          fetched or stepped past by the cursor will be locked.</p><p>When locking clause appears in
          a sub-<codeph>SELECT</codeph>, the rows locked are those returned to the outer query by
          the sub-query. This might involve fewer rows than inspection of the sub-query alone would
          suggest, since conditions from the outer query might be used to optimize execution of the
          sub-query. For example,
          <codeblock>SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM mytable FOR UPDATE) ss WHERE col1 = 5;</codeblock>
          will lock only rows having <codeph>col1 = 5</codeph>, even though that condition is not
          textually within the sub-query. </p><p>It is possible for a <codeph>SELECT</codeph>
          command running at the <codeph>READ COMMITTED</codeph> transaction isolation level and
          using <codeph>ORDER BY</codeph> and a locking clause to return rows out of order. This is
          because <codeph>ORDER BY</codeph> is applied first. The command sorts the result, but
          might then block trying to obtain a lock on one or more of the rows. Once the
            <codeph>SELECT</codeph> unblocks, some of the ordering column values might have been
          modified, leading to those rows appearing to be out of order (though they are in order in
          terms of the original column values). This can be worked around at need by placing the
            <codeph>FOR UPDATE/SHARE</codeph> clause in a sub-query, for example
          <codeblock>SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM mytable FOR UPDATE) ss ORDER BY column1;</codeblock>Note
          that this will result in locking all rows of <codeph>mytable</codeph>, whereas <codeph>FOR
            UPDATE</codeph> at the top level would lock only the actually returned rows. This can
          make for a significant performance difference, particularly if the <codeph>ORDER
            BY</codeph> is combined with <codeph>LIMIT</codeph> or other restrictions. So this
          technique is recommended only if concurrent updates of the ordering columns are expected
          and a strictly sorted result is required. </p><p>At the <codeph>REPEATABLE READ</codeph>
          or <codeph>SERIALIZABLE</codeph> transaction isolation level this would cause a
          serialization failure (with a <codeph>SQLSTATE</codeph> of <codeph>40001</codeph>), so
          there is no possibility of receiving rows out of order under these isolation
        levels.</p></sectiondiv>

          earlier releases, setting a server configuration parameter,

          Greenplum Database is slightly more restrictive: <codeph>AS</codeph> is required if the
          new column name matches any keyword at all, reserved or not. Recommended practice is to
          use <codeph>AS</codeph> or double-quote output column names, to prevent any possible
          conflict against future keyword additions. </p><p>In <codeph>FROM</codeph> items, both the
          standard and Greenplum Database allow <codeph>AS</codeph> to be omitted before an alias
          that is an unreserved keyword. But this is impractical for output column names, because of
          syntactic ambiguities.</p></sectiondiv>

          names. Greenplum Database extends each of these clauses to allow the other choice as well
          (but it uses the standard's interpretation if there is ambiguity). Greenplum Database also
          allows both clauses to specify arbitrary expressions. Note that names appearing in an
          expression are always taken as input-column names, not as output column names.
          </p><p>SQL:1999 and later use a slightly different definition which is not entirely upward

            <codeph>OFFSET</codeph> are Greenplum Database-specific syntax, also used by MySQL. The
          SQL:2008 standard has introduced the clauses <codeph>OFFSET .. FETCH {FIRST|NEXT}
            ...</codeph> for the same functionality, as shown above. This syntax is also used by IBM
          DB2. (Applications for Oracle frequently use a workaround involving the automatically
          generated <codeph>rownum</codeph> column, which is not available in Greenplum Database, to
          implement the effects of these clauses.)</p></sectiondiv>
      <sectiondiv><b>FOR NO KEY UPDATE, FOR UPDATE, FOR SHARE, and FOR KEY SHARE</b>
        <p>Although <codeph>FOR UPDATE</codeph> appears in the SQL standard, the standard allows it
          only as an option of <codeph>DECLARE CURSOR</codeph>. Greenplum Database allows it in any
            <codeph>SELECT</codeph> query as well as in sub-<codeph>SELECT</codeph>s, but this is an
          extension. The <codeph>FOR NO KEY UPDATE</codeph>, <codeph>FOR SHARE</codeph>, and
            <codeph>FOR KEY SHARE</codeph> variants, as well as the <codeph>NOWAIT</codeph> option,
          do not appear in the standard. </p></sectiondiv>
      <sectiondiv><b>Data-Modifying Statements in WITH</b><p>Greenplum Database allows <codeph>INSERT</codeph>,
        <codeph>UPDATE</codeph>, and <codeph>DELETE</codeph> to be used as <codeph>WITH</codeph>
          queries. This is not found in the SQL standard.</p></sectiondiv>
      <sectiondiv id="section23"><b>Nonstandard Clauses</b><p>The clause <codeph>DISTINCT ON</codeph> is
