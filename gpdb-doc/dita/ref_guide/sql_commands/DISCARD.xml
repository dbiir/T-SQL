      <title>Description</title>
  <p><codeph>DISCARD</codeph> releases internal resources associated with a database session. This command is useful for partially or fully
    resetting the session's state. There are several subcommands to
    release different types of resources; the <codeph>DISCARD ALL</codeph>
      variant subsumes all the others, and also resets additional state.
