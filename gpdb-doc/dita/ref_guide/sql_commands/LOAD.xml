server address space. If the file had been loaded previously, it is first
unloaded. This command is primarily useful to unload and reload a shared
library file that has been changed since the server first loaded it.
To make use of the shared library, function(s) in it need to be declared
using the <codeph>CREATE FUNCTION</codeph> command. </p><p>The file name is specified in the same way as for shared library names
in <codeph>CREATE FUNCTION</codeph>; in particular, one may rely on a
search path and automatic addition of the system's standard shared
library file name extension.</p><p>Note that in Greenplum Database the shared library file (<codeph>.so</codeph>
file) must reside in the same path location on every host in the Greenplum
Database array (masters, segments, and mirrors).</p><p>Only database superusers can load shared library files.</p></section><section id="section4"><title>Parameters</title><parml><plentry><pt><varname>filename</varname></pt><pd>The path and file name of a shared library file. This file must exist
