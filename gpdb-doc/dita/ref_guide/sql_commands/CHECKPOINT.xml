data files have been updated to reflect the information in the log. All
data files will be flushed to disk.</p>
  <p>The <codeph>CHECKPOINT</codeph> command forces an immediate checkpoint when the command is
        issued, without waiting for a regular checkpoint scheduled by the system.
          <codeph>CHECKPOINT</codeph> is not intended for use during normal operation.</p>
  <p>If executed during recovery, the <codeph>CHECKPOINT</codeph> command
    will force a restartpoint rather than writing a new checkpoint.</p>
  <p>Only superusers may call <codeph>CHECKPOINT</codeph>.</p></section><section id="section4"><title>Compatibility</title><p>The <codeph>CHECKPOINT</codeph> command is a Greenplum Database
