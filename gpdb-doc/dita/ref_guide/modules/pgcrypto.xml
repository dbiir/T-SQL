    <body>
      <p>Greenplum Database is installed with an optional module of encryption/decryption functions
        called <codeph>pgcrypto</codeph>. The <codeph>pgcrypto</codeph> functions allow database
        administrators to store certain columns of data in encrypted form. This adds an extra layer
        of protection for sensitive data, as data stored in Greenplum Database in encrypted form
        cannot be read by anyone who does not have the encryption key, nor can it be read directly
        from the disks.</p>
      <note>The <codeph>pgcrypto</codeph> functions run inside the database server, which means that
        all the data and passwords move between <codeph>pgcrypto</codeph> and the client application
        in clear-text. For optimal security, consider also using SSL connections between the client
        and the Greenplum master server.</note>

        <p>The <codeph>pgcrypto</codeph> module is installed when you install Greenplum Database.
          Before you can use any of the functions defined in the module, you must register the
            <codeph>pgcrypto</codeph> extension in each database in which you want to use the
          functions. <ph otherprops="pivotal">Refer to <xref
