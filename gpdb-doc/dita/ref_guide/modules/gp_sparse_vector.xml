      <p>The <codeph>gp_sparse_vector</codeph> module implements a Greenplum Database 
        data type and associated functions that use compressed storage of zeros to
        make vector computations on floating point numbers faster.</p>
      <p>The <codeph>gp_sparse_vector</codeph> module is a Greenplum Database extension.</p>

        <p>The <codeph>gp_sparse_vector</codeph> module is installed when you install
          Greenplum Database. Before you can use any of the functions defined in the
          module, you must register the <codeph>gp_sparse_vector</codeph> extension in
          each database where you want to use the functions.

      <title>Using the gp_sparse_vector Module</title>
      <body>
        <p>When you use arrays of floating point numbers for various calculations,
          you will often have long runs of zeros. This is common in scientific,
          retail optimization, and text processing applications. Each floating
          point number takes 8 bytes of storage in memory and/or disk. Saving
          those zeros is often impractical. There are also many computations
          that benefit from skipping over the zeros.</p>
        <p>For example, suppose the following array of <codeph>double</codeph>s is
          stored as a <codeph>float8[]</codeph> in Greenplum Database:</p>

        <codeblock>'{0, 33, &lt;40,000 zeros>, 12, 22 }'::float8[]</codeblock>
        <p>This type of array arises often in text processing, where a dictionary may
          have 40-100K terms and the number of words in a particular document is stored
          in a vector. This array would occupy slightly more than 320KB of memory/disk,
          most of it zeros. Any operation that you perform on this data
          works on 40,001 fields that are not important.</p>
        <p>The Greenplum Database built-in <codeph>array</codeph> datatype utilizes a
          bitmap for null values, but it is a poor choice for this use case because
          it is not optimized for <codeph>float8[]</codeph> or for long runs of
          zeros instead of nulls, and the bitmap is not run-length-encoding- (RLE)
          compressed. Even if each zero were stored as a <codeph>NULL</codeph> in the
          array, the bitmap for nulls would use 5KB to mark the
          nulls, which is not nearly as efficient as it could be.</p>
        <p>The Greenplum Database <codeph>gp_sparse_vector</codeph> module defines a
          data type and a simple RLE-based scheme that is biased toward being efficient
          for zero value bitmaps. This scheme uses only 6 bytes for bitmap storage.</p>
        <note>The sparse vector data type defined by the <codeph>gp_sparse_vector</codeph>
          module is named <codeph>svec</codeph>. <codeph>svec</codeph> supports only
          <codeph>float8</codeph> vector values.</note>
        <p>You can construct an <codeph>svec</codeph> directly from a float array as 
          follows:</p>
        <codeblock>SELECT ('{0, 13, 37, 53, 0, 71 }'::float8[])::svec;</codeblock>
        <p>The <codeph>gp_sparse_vector</codeph> module supports the vector operators
          <codeph>&lt;</codeph>, <codeph>&gt;</codeph>, <codeph>*</codeph>,
          <codeph>**</codeph>, <codeph>/</codeph>, <codeph>=</codeph>,
          <codeph>+</codeph>, <codeph>sum()</codeph>, <codeph>vec_count_nonzero()</codeph>,
          and so on. These operators take advantage of the efficient sparse storage format,
          making computations on <codeph>svec</codeph>s faster.</p>
        <p>The plus (<codeph>+</codeph>) operator adds each of the terms of two
          vectors of the same dimension together. For example, if vector
          <codeph>a = {0,1,5}</codeph> and vector <codeph>b = {4,3,2}</codeph>,
you
          would compute the vector addition as follows:</p>
        <codeblock>SELECT ('{0,1,5}'::float8[]::svec + '{4,3,2}'::float8[]::svec)::float8[];
 float8  
---------
 {4,4,7}</codeblock>
        <p>A vector dot product (<codeph>%*%</codeph>) between vectors <codeph>a</codeph>
          and <codeph>b</codeph> returns a scalar result of type <codeph>float8</codeph>.
          Compute the dot product (<codeph>(0*4+1*3+5*2)=13</codeph>) as follows:</p>
        <codeblock>SELECT '{0,1,5}'::float8[]::svec %*% '{4,3,2}'::float8[]::svec;
 ?column? 
----------
       13</codeblock>
        <p>Special vector aggregate functions are also useful. <codeph>sum()</codeph>
          is self explanatory. <codeph>vec_count_nonzero()</codeph> evaluates the count
          of non-zero terms found in a set of <codeph>svec</codeph> and returns an
          <codeph>svec</codeph> with the counts. For instance, for the set of vectors
          <codeph>{0,1,5},{10,0,3},{0,0,3},{0,1,0}</codeph>, the count of non-zero terms
          would be <codeph>{1,2,3}</codeph>. Use <codeph>vec_count_nonzero()</codeph> to compute
          the count of these vectors:</p>
        <codeblock>CREATE TABLE listvecs( a svec );

INSERT INTO listvecs VALUES ('{0,1,5}'::float8[]),
    ('{10,0,3}'::float8[]),
    ('{0,0,3}'::float8[]),
    ('{0,1,0}'::float8[]);

SELECT vec_count_nonzero( a )::float8[] FROM listvecs;
 count_vec 
-----------
 {1,2,3}

      <title>Example</title>
      <body>
        <p>A text classification example that describes a dictionary and some documents
          follows. You will create Greenplum Database tables representing a dictionary
          and some documents. You then perform document classification using vector
          arithmetic on word counts and proportions of dictionary words in each
          document.</p>
        <p>Suppose that you have a dictionary composed of words in a text array. Create
          a table to store the dictionary data and insert some data (words) into the table.
          For example:</p>
          <codeblock>CREATE TABLE features (dictionary text[][]) DISTRIBUTED RANDOMLY;
INSERT INTO features 
    VALUES ('{am,before,being,bothered,corpus,document,i,in,is,me,never,now,'
            'one,really,second,the,third,this,until}');</codeblock>
        <p>You have a set of documents, also defined as an array of words. Create a
            table to represent the documents and insert some data into the table:</p>
        <codeblock>CREATE TABLE documents(docnum int, document text[]) DISTRIBUTED RANDOMLY;
INSERT INTO documents VALUES 
    (1,'{this,is,one,document,in,the,corpus}'),
    (2,'{i,am,the,second,document,in,the,corpus}'),
    (3,'{being,third,never,really,bothered,me,until,now}'),
    (4,'{the,document,before,me,is,the,third,document}');</codeblock>
        <p>Using the dictionary and document tables, find the dictionary words
          that are present in each document. To do this, you first prepare a <i>Sparse
          Feature Vector</i>, or SFV, for each document. An SFV is a vector of
          dimension <i>N</i>, where <i>N</i> is the number of dictionary words, and
          each SFV contains a count of each dictionary word in the document.</p>
        <p>You can use the <codeph>gp_extract_feature_histogram()</codeph> function to
          create an SFV from a document. <codeph>gp_extract_feature_histogram()</codeph>
          outputs an <codeph>svec</codeph> for each document that contains the count of
          each of the dictionary words in the ordinal positions of the dictionary.</p>
        <codeblock>SELECT gp_extract_feature_histogram(
    (SELECT dictionary FROM features LIMIT 1), document)::float8[], document
        FROM documents ORDER BY docnum;

     gp_extract_feature_histogram        |                     document                         
-----------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------
 {0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0} | {this,is,one,document,in,the,corpus}
 {1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0} | {i,am,the,second,document,in,the,corpus}
 {0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1} | {being,third,never,really,bothered,me,until,now}
 {0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0} | {the,document,before,me,is,the,third,document}

SELECT * FROM features;
                                               dictionary
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {am,before,being,bothered,corpus,document,i,in,is,me,never,now,one,really,second,the,third,this,until}</codeblock>
        <p>The SFV of the second document, "i am the second document in the corpus",
          is <codeph>{1,3*0,1,1,1,1,6*0,1,2}</codeph>. The word "am" is the first
          ordinate in the dictionary, and there is <codeph>1</codeph> instance of it
          in the SFV. The word "before" has no instances in the document, so its value
          is <codeph>0</codeph>; and so on.</p>
        <p><codeph>gp_extract_feature_histogram()</codeph> is very speed optimized - it
          is a single routine version of a hash join that processes large numbers of
          documents into their SFVs in parallel at the highest possible speeds.</p>
        <p>For the next part of the processing, generate a sparse vector of the
          dictionary dimension (19). The vectors that you generate for each
          document are referred to as the <i>corpus</i>.</p>
        <codeblock>CREATE table corpus (docnum int, feature_vector svec) DISTRIBUTED RANDOMLY;

INSERT INTO corpus
    (SELECT docnum, 
        gp_extract_feature_histogram(
            (select dictionary FROM features LIMIT 1), document) from documents);</codeblock>

        <p>Count the number of times each feature occurs at least once in all
          documents:</p>
        <codeblock>SELECT (vec_count_nonzero(feature_vector))::float8[] AS count_in_document FROM corpus;

            count_in_document
-----------------------------------------
 {1,1,1,1,2,3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,1}</codeblock>
        <p>Count all occurrences of each term in all documents:</p>
        <codeblock>SELECT (sum(feature_vector))::float8[] AS sum_in_document FROM corpus;

             sum_in_document
-----------------------------------------
 {1,1,1,1,2,4,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,5,2,1,1}</codeblock>

        <p>The remainder of the classification process is vector math. The count is
          turned into a weight that reflects <i>Term Frequency / Inverse Document Frequency</i>
          (tf/idf). The calculation for a given term in a given document is:</p>
        <codeblock>#_times_term_appears_in_this_doc * log( #_docs / #_docs_the_term_appears_in )</codeblock>
        <p><codeph>#_docs</codeph> is the total number of
          documents (4 in this case). Note that there is one divisor for each
          dictionary word and its value is the number of times that word appears in the
          document.</p>
        <p>For example, the term "document" in document 1 would have a weight of
          <codeph>1 * log( 4/3 )</codeph>. In document 4, the term would have a weight
          of <codeph>2 * log( 4/3 )</codeph>. Terms that appear in every document 
          would have weight <codeph>0</codeph>.</p>
        <p>This single vector for the whole corpus is then scalar product
          multiplied by each document SFV to produce the tf/idf.</p>
        <p>Calculate the tf/idf:</p>
        <codeblock>SELECT docnum, (feature_vector*logidf)::float8[] AS tf_idf 
    FROM (SELECT log(count(feature_vector)/vec_count_nonzero(feature_vector)) AS logidf FROM corpus)
    AS foo, corpus ORDER BY docnum;

        <p>You can determine the <i>angular distance</i> between one document and the

        <codeblock>CREATE TABLE weights AS

        FROM (SELECT log(count(feature_vector)/vec_count_nonzero(feature_vector))

        <p>Calculate the angular distance between the first document and every other

        <codeblock>SELECT docnum, trunc((180.*(ACOS(dmin(1.,(tf_idf%*%testdoc)/(l2norm(tf_idf)*l2norm(testdoc))))/(4.*ATAN(1.))))::numeric,2)

      4 |            80.02</codeblock>
        <p>You can see that the angular distance between document 1 and itself is 0
          degrees, and between document 1 and 3 is 90 degrees because they share no
          features at all.</p>
