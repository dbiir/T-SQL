  <title>Greenplum Database Best Practices</title>
  <body>
    <p>A best practice is a method or technique that has consistently shown results superior to
      those achieved with other means. Best practices are found through experience and are proven to
      reliably lead to a desired result. Best practices are a commitment to use any product
      correctly and optimally, by leveraging all the knowledge and expertise available to ensure
      success. </p>
    <p>This document does not teach you how to use Greenplum Database features. Links are provided
      to other relevant parts of the Greenplum Database documentation for information on how to use
      and implement specific Greenplum Database features. This document addresses the most important
      best practices to follow when designing, implementing, and using Greenplum Database. </p>
    <p>It is not the intent of this document to cover the entire product or compendium of features,
      but rather to provide a summary of <i>what matters most</i> in Greenplum Database. This
      document does not address <i>edge</i> use cases.  While edge use cases can further leverage
      and benefit from Greenplum Database features, they require a proficient knowledge and
      expertise with these features, as well as a deep understanding of your environment, including
      SQL access, query execution, concurrency, workload, and other factors. </p>
    <p>By mastering these best practices, you will increase the success of your Greenplum Database
      clusters in the areas of maintenance, support, performance, and scalability. </p>
