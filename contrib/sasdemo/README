This package consists of several components:

   formatter : defines database stored procedures for formatting binary data
   sender    : defines an executable to handle database -> SAS IO
   receiver  : defines an executable to handle SAS -> database IO
   sas       : Dummy executables that pretend to be SAS
   sql       : Example schema and usage
   test      : Simple test framework

Basic dataflow:

 * Reading From the database:
  
    1) SAS Process opens sockets to receive data

    2) SAS Process calls database query:  
	   INSERT into example_out  SELECT * FROM example

    3) External table uses formatter to convert records to binary output

	4) External table sends binary data to sender executable

	5) sender executable connects to SAS sockets and sends data

	6) Data completes sender closes sockets, sas processes do calculations

 * Writing To the database

    1) SAS Process calls database query
	   INSERT into example    SELECT * FROM example_in;

	2) External Table launches listener to receive data from SAS

    3) listener opens sockets to receive data

	4) SAS Process connects to sockets and starts sending data

	5) listerer receives binary data and sends it to external table

	6) External table uses formmatter function to translate binary data
	   into database records.
