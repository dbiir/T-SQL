 *
 *	create table t (a integer, b text, c integer)

 *	create index t_idx on t (b);

 *	At this point, the t_idx index has created AO blockdir relations for all

 *
 *	create table t_exch (a integer, b text, c integer)

 *	The partition which was swapped into the hierarchy with EXCHANGE does not

 *	a problem, but when pg_dump generates DDL for the above situation it will
 *	create the index in such a way that it covers the entire hierarchy, as in
 *	its original state. The below snippet illustrates the dumped DDL:
 *
 *	create table t ( ... )
 *		...
 *		partition by (... );
 *	create index t_idx on t ( ... );
 *
 *	This creates a problem for the Oid synchronization in pg_upgrade since it
 *	expects to find a preassigned Oid for the AO blockdir relations for each
 *	partition. A longer term solution would be to generate DDL in pg_dump which
 *	creates the current state, but for the time being we disallow upgrades on
 *	cluster which exhibits this.
